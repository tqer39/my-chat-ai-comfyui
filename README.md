# My Chat AI ComfyUI

A powerful integration system that bridges conversational AI interfaces with ComfyUI's visual programming environment for
Stable Diffusion workflows. This project enables users to control complex image generation pipelines through natural
language commands, democratizing access to advanced AI image generation capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert chat commands into structured ComfyUI workflow operations
- **NSFW Content Management**: Integrated ComfyUI-Nudenet for intelligent content filtering and safety
- **Multi-Platform Chat Integration**: Support for Discord, Slack, web interfaces, and custom chatbots
- **Dynamic Workflow Creation**: Generate and modify ComfyUI workflows based on conversational input
- **Real-time Execution Monitoring**: Track workflow progress and provide user feedback
- **Intelligent Parameter Extraction**: Automatically parse and map parameters from natural language

## 🎯 Target Users

- **End Users**: Generate and manipulate images using natural language instead of complex visual programming
- **Developers**: Build chat-based applications with advanced image generation capabilities
- **AI Artists**: Use conversational interfaces for iterating on image generation workflows
- **Content Creators**: Safely generate content with built-in NSFW filtering and management
